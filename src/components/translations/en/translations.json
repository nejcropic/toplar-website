  "about": {
    "text1": "In 1991, we opened a bistro in a building that had served as a stable in the past. Later, we expanded our offerings to include pizzas and hamburgers. Since then, we have upgraded our premises with a large terrace and garden, and in 2019, we expanded and fully renovated the pizzeria. The interior and exterior of the pizzeria reflect our love for antiques, giving the space a homely feel while also contributing to the preservation of the cultural heritage of the wider Dolenjska region. A special touch to our pizzeria is given by the hayrack next to the main building, which we have adapted for parties and private events.",
    "text2": "The hayrack, also locally known as 'kazuc', with its wooden and open structure, is an unmistakable part of the Slovenian rural landscape. In Dolenjska, the so-called double hayrack or 'toplar' predominates. Initially, hayracks were used for drying and storing crops, but nowadays, they mainly store agricultural machinery and tools. In the past, hayracks also had a social purpose, which we continue to preserve at Pizzeria Toplar. Toplar's hayrack has been converted for parties and private events, using only old materials from the floor and granary.",
    "text3": "Zagraška valley, \n you are so beautiful.\n You have sunny ribs \n and small villages.\n\n Green Krka \n quietly murmurs.\n Through the deep channel \n it rushes into the distance.\n\n There, a white church \n stands by the Krka.\n Adornly beautifying \n the friendly Zagraška valley.\n\n Lojze Zupančič",
    "text4": "Just a stone's throw from the village of Zagradec along the river Krka, our Park Loka is located. During the hot summer days, it offers refreshing opportunities in the pleasantly cool river at its waterfalls and in the shade of various trees surrounding the park. We have enriched the park with numerous planted flowers and shrubs, and on the slope above the river, we have created a sense of landscape diversity with archways and rock gardens."
